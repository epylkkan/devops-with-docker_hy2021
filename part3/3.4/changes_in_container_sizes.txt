Base for frontend and backend was the version created in the exercise 3.3.

Container sizes before (3.3) and after (3.4) optimization 
- frontend:  929 MB ->  904 MB
- backend: 1.07 GB -> 1.07 GB 

The reduction in the size for frontend was achieved by chaining the RUN statementes and removal the files not needed.
In backend it was possible only to chain the RUN statements which did not have an impact contrary to the expectations.
