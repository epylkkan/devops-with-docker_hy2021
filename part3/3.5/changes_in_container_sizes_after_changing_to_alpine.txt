Base for frontend and backend was the version created in the exercise 3.4.

Container sizes before (3.3), after optimization (3.4) and after further optimization (3.5) 
- frontend:  929 MB ->  904 MB -> 307 MB
- backend: 1.07 GB -> 1.07 GB -> 572 MB


Final step reductions were coming from changing the OS-image to Alpine.
Steps in the Dockerfiles to install node.js, go etc. had to be adjusted to Alpine.
